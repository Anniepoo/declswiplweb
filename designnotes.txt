need clp(str)

{.myclass}i c_str_num  

elements -

 * jquery type selectors
 * some language for expressing 'innerhtml'  'loc' etc
{.myclass div}i          the innerhtml
{.myclass div}loc        the location
{.myclass div}loc_off    the location offset by mouse pointer delta (for dragging)


 * clp(str)
{.myclass }i  c_str_num somevar

 * some way of handling nondet within selectors I haven't worked out yet (eg line above)
   maybe each is a mini-session with a hash?
   how do things get added?

 * on_server operator
{.myclass }i  #~~> var_on_server 
   what about webforms where the form is in inconsistent state til submit, and how do we do the failure?  
   (this isn't about making sure some webform is 'consistent' on user input, that's still app programmers job)
   (maybe so, but how's that look then?)
   (chr on each element to say is/isn't valid, and submit button action depends on wiring 

have the notion of time - this rule holds at submit, this rule holds within UI feedback time
